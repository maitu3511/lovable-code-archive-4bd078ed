## Website architecture

- Keep the imported content pages and shared WebsiteLayout except explicit user corrections; the supplied source defines the website experience.
- Retain the root index.html byte-for-byte as supplied while TanStack routes run the website; the supported runtime does not use a legacy HTML entry point.
- Resolve page, logo, and font assets directly to absolute public CDN URLs from the imported asset manifest; external hosts do not provide Lovable-relative proxies or the app's media redirects.
- Build with Nitro preset "netlify" and renderer disabled for external hosting; otherwise Nitro serves the legacy root index.html as every page and the site is blank.
